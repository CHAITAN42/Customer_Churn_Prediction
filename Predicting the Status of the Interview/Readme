📄 Predicting Interview Status (Machine Learning)

A machine learning project to predict interview outcomes — Selected / Consider / Rejected — using structured interview evaluation metrics.

🎯 Objective

Predict interview results using the following evaluation parameters:

Key Features

Logical reasoning scores

Attitude evaluation

Personality evaluation

Communication score

Interview duration

Confidence & interaction

Compliance ratio

Goal

Support HR with data-driven hiring, reduce subjective judgment, and understand which factors impact selection.
